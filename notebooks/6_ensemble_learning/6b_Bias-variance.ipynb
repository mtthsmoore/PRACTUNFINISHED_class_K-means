Machine learning theory has shown that the prediction error such a model makes can be broken down into three parts: **the bias, the variance, and the irreducible error**.\n",

By expected prediction we mean the average prediction of models trained on different train set samples. In the figure above we can see that for low bias models the average (center point of the dart locations) is very close to the correct value. These models are able to predict the correct value. High bias models are not able to predict the correct value for any of the train set samples.\n",

        "**The error due to variance** is the variability of a model prediction for a given data point. The variance does not care about the correct value that we try to predict but instead looks at the variance of the prediction for different train set samples. In the figure above we can see that low variance models tend to hit the same (or very close) location for each train set sample, while predictions of high variance models are much more dependant on the actual choice of the train set sample.\n",

For instance, when describing a protein sequence by a feature vector to train a model that predicts the function of a protein based on these features then the randomness (or unknown) comes from the environment (or context) in which a protein acts that can also influence the function of a protein. \n",
